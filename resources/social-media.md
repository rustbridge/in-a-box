# RustBridge Social Media Guide
Social Media can be a very powerful tool to leverage your event, but also to motivate attendees to share their results! Because it’s so powerful, it’s very helpful and sometimes necessary to set concrete rules for usage by not only organizers and teachers, but also attendees.


## Photo Guidelines

This is the part that is necessary. You want to make sure that your event is governed by a photo taking policy, meaning that you want to ask for people’s *consent* before you take their picture. The same thing goes for attendees taking pictures.

Assume that every individual person is **not** ok with having their picture taken until you ask them to. The easiest way to do this is to sort this out at the beginning by asking the crowd of attendees if they’re okay with it. If not everyone is, *don’t* call them out — tell them that it’s okay, and ask the rest of the group to either be careful with or refrain from taking pictures with people in them altogether.


## Social Media Hashtags

A cool thing to do is to encourage attendees and teachers to post their learnings or other findings under a hashtag on platforms like Twitter or Instagram. This hashtag should be called `#RustBridgeLOCATION` or `#RustBridgeIDENTIFIER`, so like `#RustBridgeBerlin` or `#RustBridgeDC`. It’s also okay to just post under the `#RustBridge` hashtag, or both! Incentivize tagging posts by offering to retweet them with your event’s account, or the official RustBridge account, but be careful that they don’t violate your photo taking rules, as discussed in the previous section.


## Social Media Accounts

If you run a recurring RustBridge event, you might want to consider setting up a separate Social Media account for your event. Twitter is usually the best network to consider for this, although Facebook Pages, if managed correctly, can have a lot of influence, too. Be careful who you give access to the account. A preferred way of sharing access to Twitter accounts is, instead of sharing the password, using [TweetDeck Teams](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2015/introducing-tweetdeck-teams.html), which not only work without a password, but also have different access levels.

During the event, you can track the hashtags you define and retweet posts accordingly. If you want to, ask people whether it’s okay to retweet their stuff, since some people prefer not to get the exposure.

For a one-off event, it’s better to just use your personal account (if you want), or send a direct message to the [RustBridge](https://twitter.com/RustBridge) Twitter account to ask them to retweet posts under a certain hashtag (or just a specific post).


## Tips & Tricks

The key to using Social Media in a non-intrusive, but still influential way is to *ask before you take actions that affect other people*. If you need any help, again, you can send a direct message to the aforementioned RustBridge Twitter account, or file an issue under the [rustbridge/team](https://github.com/rustbridge/team) repository.
